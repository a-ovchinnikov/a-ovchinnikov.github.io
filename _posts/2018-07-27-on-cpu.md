In this post I will discuss CPU: what it is in its simplest form and what is
required to build one. I will illustrate the post with circuits modelled in
[Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

CPU Demystified
---------------

When trying to understand CPUs it is crucial to remember that internally they
consist of a multitude of much simpler elements: registers, counters, basic
logic gates.  Each of these subunits is quite unsophisticated, but
operating together in proper order they create complex behaviour of a CPU. The
work of CPU is a carefully orchestrated sequence of actions of the subunits.
Therefore the task of designing a CPU breaks down to figuring out which
subunits are necessary to fulfil higher-level contracts and how they should
interact, in which sequence and with whom.

Consider a counter. On a figure below it is shown as it is seen by a user of
[Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/). 

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/counter_cropped.png" style="width:50%"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> A counter. 'In' -- 8-bit wide input; 'Out' -- 8-bit wide output; 'Load' and
 'Count' -- single bit control inputs; 'CLK' -- clock input; 'RES' -- asynchronous
reset input.</i>
</p>

A moderately complex circuit which could store, load, increment or decrement
binary values. Without any external stimulus a counter just stores whatever
happens to be inside it as long as power is present, with output set to
stored value.  When a clock pulse arrives the counter performs one of four
actions depending on which logic levels are present on its control inputs.
Options available are presented in a table below

{% highlight none %}
LOAD    COUNT      ACTION ON CLOCK
-------------------------------------------
  1       0      Load value from data input
  1       1      Decrement value
  0       1      Increment value
  0       0      Do nothing
{% endhighlight %}

Reset input is asynchronous: whenever a pulse arrives it resets value to zero.

Now consider the following scenario: some value present on input must be
incremented.  I believe it is rather obvious that it could be done by first
loading the value into the counter, then incrementing it. To load a value one
must set 'In' bus to it, set 'LOAD' to high, 'COUNT' to low and then
issue a clock pulse. To increment the value 'LOAD" must be set to low, 'COUNT'
to high and a clock pulse must be applied.  Note that each of the four steps
above could be represented with constant levels on corresponding inputs:

{% highlight none %}
          LOAD     COUNT    CLOCK
---------------------------------
Step 1      1        0        0
Step 2      1        0        1
Step 3      0        1        0
Step 4      0        1        1
{% endhighlight %}

If only a way existed for creating such tables in hardware! Then proper level
changes would have happened when stepping through rows. Good news are that such
tables are not only possible, but are quite trivial to implement. The values
themselves could be as simple as resistors pulling to either high or low level,
selection between steps could be achieved with multiplexers:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/Multiplexer.gif"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> A multiplexer. 'Address' -- 2-bit wide bus, 'Output enabled' -- allows a signal
to propagate from one of inputs to output when set to high.</i>
</p>

A multiplexer connects one of its inputs to its output depending on input
address value. Thus  the only thing left is to provide means to actually select
an input.  Fortunately we already have counters at our disposition, so we can
use one four-bit counter to count pulses from some source and drive a
multiplexer:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/MuxWithCounter.gif"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> A multiplexer with line address provided by a counter.</i>
</p>

Putting everything together it is easy to build a circuit that looks and
operates like the one below:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/program.gif" style="width:75%"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> A circuit that performs 'Load and Increment' operation. Each step is
encoded with three constants 'Load', 'Count' and 'Clock' which determine logic
levels on corresponding input of a counter. Constant groups are connected via
3-bit buses to a multiplexer which switches between them depending on step
number provided by step counter.
</i>
</p>

A counter counts pulses producing sequential addresses for multiplexer to step
through control table. Multiplexer in turn switches between input values.
Note, that Logisim allows to switch an entire bus with a single multiplexer
which I did in this example. In real world one would need to use several
multiplexers together to achieve the same results.

This circuit does not perform anything useful yet, but it illustrates
how one can orchestrate complex behaviour of different components. Consider,
for example, two such counters, one of which provides an input for another.  It
is easy to imagine a table that would copy a value from one to another.  What
could be the use for such a setup, a careful reader might wonder? Well, name
the first counter A, the second counter B and get a free _mov A, B_ implementation.

Back to the load and increment (LAI) circuit. What if one needs to not only
increment, but possibly decrement a value loaded into the counter (i.e.
implement LAD)? Certainly a table for load and decrement would come in handy:

{% highlight none %}
          LOAD    COUNT    CLOCK
--------------------------------
Step 1      1       0        0
Step 2      1       0        1
Step 3      1       1        0
Step 4      1       1        1
{% endhighlight %}

This table could be implemented in exactly the same way as the previous one.
Now to be able to switch between two functions some device is needed that
somehow selects which table to use. For example, one could decide to switch
control signals for the counter with yet another multiplexer with one bit
address. Address input of this second multiplexer could be fed with a code
representing either LAI or LAD action. The action to be performed could be
selected with a simple mechanical switch or a constant in the case of Logisim
circuit:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/lailad_basic2.gif"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> LAI/LAD basic circuit. Multiplexer tagged with 'LAI' governs Load and
Increment instruction, multiplexer tagged with 'LAD' governs Load and
Decrement. 'Inst Sel' multiplexer selects which of control tables to use to
drive the counter.</i> </p>

What if several LAI or LAD actions have to be implemented in sequence? One
option is to manually toggle operation control switch when needed, the other
one is to use one more table to store the sequence of operations to be
performed.  Consider this -- an addition counter, let us call it 'Program
Counter', points to position in this sequence table which is again implemented
as a multiplexer switching constant values. Program counter gets advanced each
time any of operations has finished. In general this could be achieved by
adding an extra column to control tables of operations, which would reset
operation counter and increment program counter. Also it might be necessary to
block operation counters for all operations except the current one since
different operations could consist of different number of steps and allowing
all counters to increment would result in them being in random state at the
start of their operation execution.  Alternatively one could consider resetting
all operation counters prior to operation execution. In the case of LAI/LAD,
however, it is possible to shortcut a little: first of all, both operations
have the same length, so operation counters can safely run in parallel without
causing inconsistencies, and second both operations require four steps to be
performed, which allows to use simple counters which naturally reset to zero
when reaching the last step. Counter overflow also generates carry pulse which
could be used to advance program counter. Resulting circuit is shown below:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/lidp2.gif"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> LAI/LAD circuit equipped with a program counter (PC) runs a program.</i>
</p>

The circuit above could be optimized since most of control signals remain the
same for both instructions and thus could be produced by one table, but doing
so will needlessly overcomplicate the example so I will not do that now.

Actually this is basically all one needs to build a CPU: just throw in control
tables for all individual instructions, add some switching logic that selects
proper table basing on current instruction value and possibly the state
of CPU -- both flags and values held in registers could affect selection, and
that's it. The only problem with this approach is that it is rather tedious and
error-prone. If designed without proper care addition of new instructions or
modification of existing ones could affect large parts of circuit and introduce
rather unpleasant bugs. In short, this approach does not scale easily.

Fortunately this is not the only option available. The other option
is to use read-only memory with some additional components to implement control
unit.

ROM-based Control Unit
----------------------


Instead of wiring multiple multiplexers one could use read-only memory.
<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/ROMmodel.gif" style="width:50%"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> A ROM. 'A' -- address input; 'D' -- data output; 'Sel' -- chip select,
supposed to shut memory off the circuit with tri-state buffer when chip is not
used.</i> </p>

Memory implementation choices are the topic of a separate post, so for now let
us do some wishful thinking and pretend that we already have ROMs: devices that
map addresses to values.  In the context of a control unit for a CPU 'address'
is somewhat misleading term since we are interested in mapping between a
combination of code of instruction to be carried out, number of step inside
that particular instruction, possibly some internal state flags (for instance
consider control of conditional jumps) and a vector describing both current
state of all control pins of all subelements and next step to be taken.

A figure below shows how a ROM could be wired to be used as control unit:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/rom_control_unit.gif"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> Basic ROM-based control unit. Here address in ROM is obtained from current
instruction and value stored in 'Next Step' register. Location in ROM defined by
this combination (Control Table Entry) consists of a control vector defining states of
all control inputs of all subunits for this step and next step to be taken.</i>
</p>

A step register holds current step, switching to the next step happens on
clock.  Clock pulse makes step register latch the next step code. That in turn
transform the next step into current one and causes ROM to change its output
accordingly. Now to build a control unit one has to populate a ROM with proper
values. Below is an example of a control table implementing LAI/LAD
instructions:

{% highlight none %}
             ADDRESS            STORED VALUE
          +-----------+   +----------------------+
MNEMONIC  CODE     STEP   STATE VECTOR   NEXT STEP   -->   ADDR    VALUE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAI        0        00        1000          01              00      x21
           0        01        1010          10              01      x2a
           0        10        0100          11              02      x13
           0        11        0111          00              03      x1c

LAD        1        00        1000          01              04      x21
           1        01        1010          10              05      x2a
           1        10        1100          11              06      x33
           1        11        1111          00              07      x3c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATE VECTOR = [LOAD, COUNT, CLK, PCCLK]
{% endhighlight %}

Note extra PC clock added to the state vector which is needed to step over
to the next instruction.

Built around this ROM-based control unit LAI/LAD machine will look like this:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/lidr_new2.gif"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> LAI/LAD built with ROM control unit. ROM used for the control unit has
3-bit wide address bus and 6-bit data bus. Program ROM has 3-bit wide
address bus as well and 1-bit data bus which is enough for simple tests.</i>
</p>
Note that "program" is stored in a ROM as well. Also note an inverter in the PC
clock line: by default a counter in Logisim updates its state on the rising
edge of clock pulse which is a little undesirable here, since it would cause
PC increment and stepping out of a command before it is finished. Thus a
counter must either be explicitly configured to use falling edge or a negating
element could be used to swap edges.

While being rather wasteful gate-wise this implementation of control unit is
very easy to understand and reproduce. More importantly it is exceptionally
easy to extend, all one needs to do is to populate corresponding spaces in ROM.
And in case of running out of space in one ROM one could easily add more ROMs.
The same holds true also for the state vector's size: if you are not satisfied
with data port width of your ROM just connect several of them in parallel.
Also I personally find it good that such control unit could be designed and
debugged with just pen and paper in the most straightforward manner possible.
Of course having an automated tool for filling such tables reduces the strain,
but I like to have a back-up low tech option available.  Another interesting
option that could come in handy for control table debugging is RAM-based
control unit which can speed-up testing and debugging real hardware.  Moreover,
such control units allow to add instructions gradually to already working
systems, or even modify them in run time which could be a source of endless fun
and occasionally of bugs.

Afterword
---------

The design above touches lightly on the topic of building a CPU. Moreover, it
is deliberately crude and unoptimized. Yet I hope it turned to be very
staightforward and easy to understand. I have deliberately left out lots of
topics like control ROM space optimization which could be achieved by
compressing state vector and using auxiliary circuitry to decode it, embedding
control sequeces into instruction codes themselves or removing most of the ROM
altogether and relying instead on multiphase clock and careful instruction
design. While capable of producing much more compact designs I believe these
techniques obscure the basics, and having good grasp of basic designs, even
crude ones, is essential for being able to come up with optimisations when such
need arises.

Another possibly surprising decision is not to discuss arithmetic-logic units.
I find ALUs simultaneously trivial enough and well-described in multiple
sources and complicated enough to distract from important question of
subcomponent orchestration. Moreover, it is perfectly possible to build a CPU
completely lacking distinct ALU and it would be as complete as any one with it
(consider, for example, a BrainFuck computer). Thus I decided to discuss them
later in a separate post.

**Updates**
===========

**00** Original version of this blog post contained a slightly different
animation of a LAI/LAD ROM-based circuit. It lacked invertor on PC clock line
which resulted in harmless (for this design), but rather untidy jumps at the
end of some command execution. It looked like this:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/one_cpu/lidr_problem.gif"> </p>
<p align="center">
<i> PC jumps over the last step of current to a different command.</i>
</p>

As [settis](https://github.com/settis) has accurately noted this behavior while
not being exactly wrong is rather confusing, so I updated the post with
improved circuit animation.

Another kudos goes to [Yar](https://github.com/ya-isakov) for pointing out
multiple inconsistencies in the original post and providing suggestions on
improvement.

Also following the feedback I am adding a
[repository](https://github.com/a-ovchinnikov/blog-supplementaries) with
Logisim projects and images used in this series  so everyone could experiment
with them.
