In this post I will discuss the options available to a reasonably dedicated
hobbyist building a computer from ground up, their strong and weak points.
I will constrain myself to devices that need electricity to operate.

Maze of twisty little components
--------------------------------

The moment I decided to work on a computer I got to decide which technology it
will be based on. In the XXI century one can design and implement very complex
systems using FPGAs, but I wanted to use discrete components to achieve this
goal. The most obvious choice -- logic chips -- just creates more questions.
Which level of integration should be considered discrete? Should the design be
implemented with basic logic gates only or is medium-level of integration
fine? Or maybe to abandon all fears and to go with transistors? And more
importantly what is the plan to deal with memory? As [Mr.
MÃ¼eller](http://www.6502.org/users/dieter/) has once put it, it looks strange when
you implement your CPU using discrete transistors and then throw in a few
millions of them in a form of RAM chip. Actually RAM design choice could
provide a lot of headache, since to be able to compute something interesting
one will need substantial amounts of memory, and by substantial I mean hundreds
of bytes which is not that much considering modern standards, but could mean
either hours of toil or substantial spendings. For instance when each byte is
made separately from discrete transistors -- it takes about one hundred of them
_per byte_. And letting you mind run wild it is easy to come up with even more
general question: whether it is feasible to build a practical computer
from raw elements like silicon, copper, maybe some zinc oxide? It doesn't sound
all that crazy given that people state that they can build nonlinear elements and
even [memristors](http://sparkbangbuzz.com/memristor/memristor.htm) out of
rather mundane elements, so maybe it is worth it to try to repeat such success
and get super awesome memristor memory? (I considered all these options
and homemade transistors look like a realistic goal, however extremely 
labor intensive.  As for memristors those turned to be a disappointment since I
have repeatedly failed to reproduce reported results let alone to build
something out of them). 

Over time I have considered and eventually rejected multiple options most
feasible of which are presented in the handy table below:

{% highlight none %}
Basic elements          Clock Freq, Hz        Effort       Power Consumption
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Relays                         5            Medium-High     Medium-High 
Magnetic circuits             1k            High            Medium
Vacuum tubes                 10k            High            Very High
Gas-filled tubes              1k            High            Low-Medium
Transistors                  50k            Medium-High     Low
Other chips                  50k            Medium          Low
Logic gates                  50k            Medium          Low
MSI chips                   100k            Low-Medium      Very Low
{% endhighlight %}

Here basic element is the minimal unit available to the designer, clock
frequency is a ballpark estimate for maximum clock speed which could be
achieved without serious tuning, effort is the expected amount of effort
(roughly speaking time and money product) required to put into a computer,
power consumption is yet another ballpark estimate of amount of power needed
for the thing to run with "Low" being below 100W and "High" above 1kW.

Let's discuss each option in greater details. Relays go first in the table so
let us start with them.  Relays are simple electro-mechanical devices which
could be switched on or off by passing a current through them. Being able to
switch between two states immediately makes them a good match for binary logic
building blocks.

</p>

Of course relays [have](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/)
[been](http://www.nablaman.com/relay/)
[used](http://www.electronixandmore.com/projects/relaycomputertwo/index.html)
[multiple](http://www.northdownfarm.co.uk/rory/tim/tim-8.htm)
[times](http://www.computerculture.org/projects/rc3/) in many interesting
designs which should not discourage anybody willing to try a hand at designing
another relay computer or two.

What I like about relays is that they could be built out of very basic low-tech
materials.  All you really need to start rolling your own relays are a spool of
magnet wire and some scrap iron. Basic hand tools could be helpful as well, but
a really determined person could probably build them by just applying brute
force and sheer willpower.

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/comp_intro/diy_relay.svg"> </p>
<p align="center"> <i> DIY relay. "In" is input terminal, "O1" and "O2" are
output terminals; "In" is normally collected to "O2". When current is passing
through control coil "CC" (between control terminals "+C" and "-C") magnetic
material "IP" moves down and pulls on "MC" connector which disconnects "In"
from "O2" and connects it to "O1".</i></p>

Of course you could buy factory made relays, but that could either limit
what could be done or skyrocket the price. Consider for example a register.
To build one out of stock element one would need to either seek latching relays
or to go ahead and implement triggers out of common off-the-shelve relays which
would requires at least two of them per bit.  However when rolling your own
relays one could consider building the following contraption:

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/comp_intro/diy_relay_latch.svg"> </p>
<p align="center"> <i> Latch "L" is suspended on a spring and could be moved by
passing current through terminals "+L" and "-L" of latch coil "LC". When
current is passing through "LC" "L" allows for free movement of relay armature
"IP" fixing it in one of two positions after current through "LC" has stopped.
</i></p>

Here the switch is kept in position by the latch which gets moved when current
flows through LC terminals. To write new value one must first unlatch armature
of data relay and apply new value. After switch changes its positions the
latch goes down and fixes it in place where it stays no matter what happens to
current through data terminals. What makes this design different from
factory-made latching relays is the ability to add arbitrary number of storing
elements so if one needs sixty four bit relay register this could be easily the
most cost-efficient way to get it. Also note, that a register built of triggers
drains current all the time while mechanical latches consume power only when
switching to new state.

Following this line of thought one could easily come up with multiple
interesting components: bus switches, oscillators and what not. But before you
have started planning your very special relay computer be warned, relays have
downsides. First of all they are rather big, you should not expect sizes less
then a couple of cubic centimeters for commercially available specimen or
rather labor-intensive home-made ones. They consume power, typical values of
switching current are about 5mA at 5V. 25mW does not sound like a lot until
you remember that you'll easily end up with several of those per bit of storage
and much more for actual processing. So while not exorbitant power budget could
be rather high. The relays are not designed for and can't switch too fast --
technically you can get hundreds of Hertz in oscillating circuits, but for a
practical digital circuit it is safer not to expect frequencies higher than
several Hertz. Also relays tend to develop issues after some number of
switchings especially when it was switching high current: arcing erodes
the surfaces of contacts and make them unreliable. On the plus side you get
vintage look and lots and lots of clicking noises when running a relay computer.
Ultimately unwillingness to invest into buying massive amounts of factory-made
relays and the amount of work required to build enough customized relays made
me rule this option out.

The next option is rather esoteric by modern standards -- magnetic circuits.

<p align="center"> <img src="/assets/comp_intro/maglogic.svg"> </p>
<p align="center"> <i> a. Magnetic OR gate; b. Magnetic NOT gate; c. Magnetic
shift register. Here thick circles represent ferrite rings with loops standing
for windings. Note that magnetic logic works with either alternating current or
with pulses.
</i></p>

A core made of ferromagnetic material with several coils can amplify or switch
alternating currents, so could be used as a building block for larger logic
elements.  On the plus side they are rather rugged -- it takes power to
actually burn copper wire and as there are no moving parts or parts operating
at extreme conditions chances of failure of individual components are low,
individual elements are relatively cheap and easy to manufacture, replace and
repair, they can operate at relatively high frequency and consume relatively
small amount of power. The downsides are the size, and most importantly the
amount of work needed to build all elements needed -- in some manual on magnetic
circuits I have seen an estimate of five minutes per core to build a single
gate. Since there are virtually no such devices readily available on the market
in case I chose them it would have required me to design and build a small
industrial line for assembling and testing magnetic elements which was way
above my expected time budget so unfortunately it was ruled out as well.

Vacuum tubes being amplifiers could be easily tricked into behaving like
switches with resulting schematics resembling transistor-based logic elements.

Vacuum tubes are rather fast easily allowing for clock frequencies of hundreds
of kilohertz and could be either found in surplus stores or relatively easily
built [from scratch](https://simplifier.neocities.org/triode.html) (note,
however, that relatively easy in this case means a small workshop equipped with
a vacuum system and enough spare time). On the downside vacuum tubes have
relatively short lifespan (from thousands to tens of thousands hours), are
rather prone to failures (so operating an installation of hundreds to thousands
of vacuum tubes could easily be reduced to non-stop search for failed elements)
and consume lots and lots of power -- each tube requiring at least a full Watt
of power. So while exceptionally aesthetically pleasing vacuum tubes were 
ruled out almost immediately.

The next option is quite exotic as well -- gas-filled tubes which in the days
of yonder were an element of choice for building inexpensive counting devices.
It was so lucrative to use gas discharge for the purpose of counting that
special counting devices -- decatrons -- have been designed and successfully
used in early computers. While decatrons have become an obscure rarity in the
modern day used mostly for building decorative vintage-looking clocks, it is
worth remembering, that counting circuits have been built out of ordinary neon
lamps and three terminal thyratrons, sometimes called relay tubes, allow
for easier control over when a lamp starts conducting.

</i></p>

Being much smaller, much less power-hungry than hard-vacuum devices and
allowing for somewhat simpler technology stack for those willing to build them
from scratch gas-filled tubes come with significant downside -- it is easy to
make an element conduct, it is much harder to cut the current and requires
separate circuitry. In terms of logic gates it means that while AND and OR gates
are trivial, NOT can't be easily built which leaves us with incomplete set of
logic functions. This effectively negates all potential gain from their usage
in general purpose logic gates and reduces gas-filled devices to counters.
Unfortunately it does not seem to be feasible to build a computer purely from
gas-filled elements and even if it were possible it would have required
significant effort, not less than needed for building a computer from discrete
transistor. Thus I ruled out gas-filled devices.

The next three options -- transistors, other chips and small-scale integration
circuits all bear very similar traits. They all are very close to be
practically useful (in case of transistors especially if one buys them instead
of building them from scratch). Transistor based computers have been build
[multiple](http://www.megaprocessor.com/)
[times](http://www.6502.org/users/dieter/mt15/mt15.htm). Also transistor gates
are extremely well documented so I won't even include  picture of one -- they
are literally everywhere. No real challenges here once you figure out how to
build NAND gate except for the need to set up a process of circuit board
manufacturing -- that has actually made me abandon this route as well, or to at
least postpone it to some distant future. The same holds true for the remaining
options of the group -- other chips and discrete logic gates. While  discrete
logic gates are quite obvious elements and I won't spend much time discussing
them, I would like to pay some attention to other chips. 

When considering integrated options other than special purpose logic gates
first thing that comes to mind is operational amplifiers. While most useful for
analog computers they can easily be made to perform logic operations. Below is
an image of gates made out of operational amplifiers:

<p align="center">
   <img src="/assets/comp_intro/op_amp_logic.svg" style="width:80%">
</p>
<p align="center"> <i>  a. OR gate; b. NOT gate. OR gate could be made with
more inputs. If a need for big fanouts arises consider replacing input
resistors with diodes.
</i></p>

The design above could be used as is or, if you are worried about fanout then
replace input resistors with diodes and don't worry about it any more.
The other interesting option is the venerable 555 timer which could be
[shown](http://www.paleotechnologist.net/?p=530) to be a NotA-And-B element and
thus be used to synthesise arbitrary elements.

All the considerations described above left me with the only option for the
first device -- medium scale integrated circuits. While rather boring they beat
every other option with the effort needed and suit well the goal of trying a
hand at building computers. They are still manufactured and will remain in
production for some time, they are prototyping board friendly and consume
miniscule amount of space and power. Also there is plenty of CAD tools to help
in design debugging. In the end future design with any hope for being actually
finished and built turned to be rather mundane, but I thought that at least I
could try my hand on it, name it "model one" and then update or rebuild with
less trivial components.
